<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #33cccc;">DIGITAL MARKETING EXPERTISE</span></h1>

<p><strong>Salon Beauty & Co. came to life as the result of several highly effective Search Engine Optimization (SEO) engagements with hair salons. 
Even though they had sought out our services and understood the how-to and why of SEO, these salon owners were still a little skeptical about impact. 
Like many of our clients, they'd previously experienced blown budgets and lackluster ROI.</strong></p>

<p>We told them, &#8220;You haven't worked with us. Give us a try.&#8221;</p>

<p>They did. And, within weeks, their skepticism switched to gratitude as they watched their sites begin to show up on the first page of Google 
results and tracked more incoming calls to their salons. The more established of the two was able to discontinue more expensive advertising contracts, and 
the other, a newer salon owner, credited us with &#8220;saving her business.&#8221; You can imagine the joy we felt having made such a 
notable business and helping to sustain her dream of owning a salon.</p>

<p>You want the best for your clients. So do we. Salon Search Party helps salon owners like you obtain and leverage the very best salon marketing at a 
price point that won&#8217;t make you want to pull your hair out.</p>
